# Project Plan - ACOM

## 1. Project Overview
ACOM (Application for Centralized Operations on Mobile) is a multiplatform mobile application developed with Flutter.  
The goal is to integrate artificial intelligence APIs and centralize smartphone functionalities in a single, user-friendly app.  

This project is part of my professional portfolio as a Systems Engineering student.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Build a clean, modular, and scalable mobile application.
- Demonstrate integration with an Artificial Intelligence API.
- Showcase centralized smartphone operations (e.g., microphone, camera, storage).
- Document the project to highlight software engineering practices.

---

## 3. Scope (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)
The first version (MVP) will include:
- A welcome screen with project branding.
- Integration with one AI API (text-based).
- Display of AI responses in the app.
- Access to at least one smartphone feature (e.g., microphone for voice input).

---

## 4. Methodology
- **Development approach:** Iterative and incremental.
- **Version control:** Git & GitHub (public repository).
- **Documentation:** README, planning documents, and in-code comments.
- **Testing:** Manual testing on emulator and physical devices.

---

## 5. Deliverables
- Source code (Flutter project).
- Technical documentation.
- Working mobile application (Android/iOS).
- GitHub repository with history of commits.

---

## Timeline

Since ACOM is a personal and educational project, there will be **no strict time restrictions**.  
Development will progress at a flexible pace, allowing learning and experimentation along the way.  

Phases (non-time-constrained):
1. Requirements definition
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Documentation & portfolio preparation

---

## 7. Risks & Considerations
- Learning curve with Flutter and APIs.
- Time constraints.
- API key management and costs (if using paid AI services).

---

## 8. Success Criteria
- The app runs successfully on Android/iOS.
- API integration works reliably.
- Documentation is complete and professional.
- Code demonstrates good practices (modularity, comments, readability).
